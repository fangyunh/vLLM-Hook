# NO `pytest.importorskip("vllm")` HERE, AND NEVER AGAIN. It used to be the first
# statement in this file, which made the ENTIRE suite hostage to an optional import:
# a Skipped raised while this conftest is being imported aborts collection of all of
# tests/, so `pytest tests/ -q -m "not gpu"` -- this plan's exit criterion -- ran ZERO
# tests. Depending on pytest version and invocation shape that surfaces either as a raw
# traceback or as a directory-level skip with a green exit 0; neither is a gate. The
# overwhelming majority of these tests are pure Python and never touch vLLM, so the
# dependency belongs at the tests that actually need it: modules importing `vllm.*` or
# `mia` call `pytest.importorskip("vllm")` themselves, at their own top. The root
# conftest.py additionally refuses to exit 0 having collected nothing, from a file that
# still loads when this one does not.

# ORDER MATTERS BELOW. The spawn pin must precede any CUDA probe (has_gpu() imports
# torch further down), and both env vars must be set before any test module imports
# vLLM -- conftest import always precedes test-module import, so this is the right
# place for them even though the vLLM guard is not.

# THE HERMETIC GATE IS  `pytest tests/ -q -m "not gpu"`  -- WITH -m, NEVER -k.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `-k` is a SUBSTRING filter over test ids. It has no idea what a GPU test is, and it got
# the answer wrong in BOTH directions:
#
#   * It INCLUDED the real engine tests in tests/use_cases/, whose names say nothing about
#     GPUs -- so they ran on a login node and the gate reported "11 failed" as routine.
#   * It EXCLUDED pure-CPU tests whose names merely CONTAIN "gpu" -- the GPU-*routing*
#     checks, which need no GPU at all.
#
# The `gpu` marker is applied to the tests that boot a real engine, so marker selection is
# what "not gpu" was always supposed to mean: `-m` deselects exactly those and nothing
# else. Do not reintroduce `-k` for this purpose.
