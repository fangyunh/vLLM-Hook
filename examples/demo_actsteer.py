"""Activation steering over `vllm serve`: the same prompt, steered and unsteered.

Steering produces no artifact, so there is nothing to analyze and nothing for `MiaClient`
to do — a plain OpenAI client is enough. Each request carries its own steer config under
``vllm_xargs["steer"]``, JSON-encoded because `vllm_xargs` only accepts scalars.
