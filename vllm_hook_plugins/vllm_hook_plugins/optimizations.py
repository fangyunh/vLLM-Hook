"""The user-facing optimization surface for FULL CUDA-graph mode.

ONE table (``PUBLIC_LEVERS``) is the whole public API. Everything else the package reads from
the environment is INTERNAL — tuning constants (ring depths, poll intervals, queue sizes),
regime-specific levers that are not a default win, and diagnostics that deliberately corrupt or
perturb. Those keep working for anyone who knows the name; they are simply not part of the
supported surface and are not accepted here.

Two ways to set a lever, in precedence order:

1. **Environment variable** — always wins. Every existing ``run_*.sh`` keeps working unchanged.
2. **Config file** — an ``"optimizations"`` block in ``model_configs/<use_case>/<model>.json``,
   alongside the ``hidden_states`` / ``params`` / ``hookq`` / ``steering`` sections::

       {
         "model_info":     {"name": "Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct"},
         "hidden_states":  {"layers": [], "mode": "last_token"},
         "optimizations":  {"artifact_dtype": "int8"}
       }

3. Unset in both -> the shipped default below.

**Defaults are the proven stack.** A lever ships ON only where a GPU measurement says it is a
gain; the rest ship OFF and stay toggleable. Nothing here is lossy or behavior-changing by
default: captured values are byte-identical to the eager path unless you opt into
``artifact_dtype``.

**Scope.** ``load_config`` runs in the DRIVER before ``LLM(...)`` spawns the workers, so the env
it sets is inherited by every worker process. That makes the config block an OFFLINE
(``HookLLM``) path: ``vllm serve`` never parses a config file, so serve callers set the env
directly (which is the same knob).
