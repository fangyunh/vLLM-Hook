"""Fixed-size GPU capture ring: the in-graph scatter writes rows here at an advancing cursor, so
nothing is overwritten within a drain window and NO per-step egress copy is needed. Logical cursors
are monotonic ints; physical slot = logical % n_slots. Reservations are whole rows (row-aligned), so
a row never straddles the wrap. One SENTINEL slot absorbs pad / no-capture lanes.

THREAD-SAFETY (off-loop consumer drain). The ring is a single-producer / single-consumer cursor:
the ENGINE thread is the ONLY writer of ``_write`` (via ``reserve``); the DRAIN CONSUMER thread is
the ONLY writer of ``_drain`` (via ``advance_drain``). No lock is taken because each cursor has one
writer and a CPython attribute read is atomic under the GIL, so:
  * ``reserve``'s ``free_rows()`` may read a slightly STALE (smaller) ``_drain`` — that only
    UNDER-counts free rows, so a reserve is refused a touch early and retried; it can never
    over-admit into un-drained rows (conservative, safe).
  * ``advance_drain`` reads ``_write`` for its assert; the consumer only drains steps whose reserve
    already completed (STORE done before the step was enqueued), so ``_drain <= _write`` holds even
    against a concurrent in-flight ``reserve``.
This invariant is load-bearing for the off-loop drain and is validated by the GPU parity oracle."""

    NEVER-DROP contract: a capturing request is never silently skipped. The engine BLOCKS on a full

    mis-sized for the workload (a single step needs more than the whole ring holds, unrelievable) or
    the off-loop consumer DIED (no one will ever free rows). It is loud and MUST PROPAGATE out of the
