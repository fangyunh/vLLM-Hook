"""A separate CPU worker that transfers a finished request's per-request file to the client
destination -- the delivery half of the per-request pipeline (capture writes the file, this
ships it out).

Off-loop-worker shape: an UNBOUNDED work queue (holds only tiny ``(req_id, src_path, dest)``
path tuples, since the artifact bytes already live on NVMe, so holding an arbitrarily long
backlog is memory-safe and IS the "hold, never drop" contract), a NON-BLOCKING ``submit`` (the
engine loop never stalls or drops, even with a stalled worker and a deep backlog), a worker
loop, and never-drop hold-and-retry semantics for a transfer that raises.

``wait(req_id, timeout)`` is the client-blocks contract: a caller that needs to know a specific
request's file has actually landed at ``dest`` blocks on a per-req ``threading.Event`` rather than
polling. It returns True only for an actual completed transfer -- a job that gave up after
exhausting its retries still wakes a blocked ``wait()`` promptly (rather than making the caller
sit out the whole timeout) but reports False, same as a real timeout. ``poll_done()`` /
``poll_failed()`` are the complementary non-blocking "what settled since I last asked" views --
done vs. permanently-gave-up -- for a caller that wants to drive its own accounting loop instead
of blocking per request. A req_id observed via ``poll_done()``/``poll_failed()`` is safe to
``submit()`` again immediately: the settle (what makes it visible to poll) and a resubmit's
re-arm of the completion Event are serialized under one lock, so a resubmit can never observe a
stale signal left over from the job it is replacing (see ``OffloadProcess.__init__``).

ONE-SUBMIT-PER-REQ_ID: ``submit()`` raises ``ValueError`` if `req_id` is already in flight (queued
or being retried) -- a shared per-req Event means a second submit while the first is in flight
could let a stale completion satisfy the new caller's ``wait()``. In the real pipeline a req_id is
delivered exactly once, so resubmitting an in-flight id is a contract violation, not a supported
flow (resubmitting a req_id that has already settled is fine and re-arms its Event).

Default ``transfer_fn`` is a shared-filesystem copy (``shutil.copy`` for a FILE,
``shutil.copytree`` for a per-request run DIRECTORY -- the disk route ships a whole per-request
run_dir of per-layer raw files + a sidecar); injectable for tests and for a future network sender
(any ``callable(src_path, dest) -> None`` that raises on failure).

BACKEND: THREAD by default (``use_process=False``). The transfer is a file/dir COPY (or a
network send) -- pure I/O that releases the GIL during the copy syscalls, so a worker THREAD never
stalls the engine's GPU forward. A real child PROCESS (``use_process=True``,
``torch.multiprocessing`` spawn, mirroring ``writer_process`` / ``server_analyze_process``) is
AVAILABLE for a future network sender that could hang uninterruptibly (a thread cannot be
force-killed; a stuck child can be ``terminate()``d) -- but for a pure copy it buys no real
isolation, so it is opt-in, not the default. An injected ``transfer_fn`` forces the thread backend
(a test closure / non-default sender is not guaranteed picklable across an mp spawn boundary; the
mp child always runs the module-level ``_default_transfer``).
