"""A separate CPU process that runs a REDUCIBLE analyzer's server-side reduce off the GPU and
off the drain consumer thread.

When the router decides a request's chosen analyzer is REDUCIBLE server-side (e.g.
``hidden_states`` with ``analyzer_spec={"reduce": "mean"|"norm"}``), it ships the small RESULT
instead of the whole per-request artifact. ``analyze_where`` (``graph/delivery_router.py``) is
``"inflight"`` (analyze from the host-buffer artifact the drain assembled -- see
``per_request_delivery.PerRequestIndex.pop_deliverable``) or ``"from_disk"`` (the artifact was too
big to hold -- stream it to a per-request file, then analyze that file). This module runs BOTH
cases entirely off the GPU forward and off the drain consumer thread, in a dedicated CPU worker.

Mirrors ``writer_process.py``'s off-loop-child shape (``torch.multiprocessing`` spawn,
``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`` + OMP/BLAS caps set in the PARENT before ``start()`` -- too late inside
the child, see that module's own docstring for why) and ``offload_process.py``'s API shape
(``submit`` non-blocking, ``wait(req_id, timeout)``, ``poll_done``/``poll_failed``, ``close``, an
injectable seam for testing).

ANALYZE CONTRACT (matches ``hook_llm.py`` / ``hook_client.py`` / ``run_utils.dispatch_disk_analyze``):
``PluginRegistry.get_analyzer(name).analyzer`` is the analyzer CLASS; instantiate it
``analyzer_cls(hook_dir, layer_to_heads)`` then call ``.analyze(analyzer_spec=..., probes=...)`` for
the in-flight/host-buffer source, or route through ``dispatch_disk_analyze(analyzer, analyzer_spec,
run_id=..., run_ids=...)`` for the on-disk source -- NOT a raw ``.analyze(run_id=...)`` call, so a
future two-pass analyzer (CoRer-style, ``run_ids=[doc, na]``) is not silently unsupported here.

TESTABILITY SEAM (mirrors ``OffloadProcess``'s injectable ``transfer_fn``): the actual invocation
runs through ``analyze_fn(source_kind, source, analyzer_name, analyzer_spec) -> result``, default =
``_default_analyze_fn`` (the registry-based real invocation above). An injected ``analyze_fn`` forces
the THREAD backend (see PROCESS-VS-THREAD below) so a no-GPU test can hand it an arbitrary Python
closure / fake analyzer without that closure needing to survive an mp spawn pickle.

``source`` SHAPE -- a plain dict carrying everything ``_default_analyze_fn`` needs (kept flat so the
4-arg ``analyze_fn`` signature above never has to grow):
  * ``source_kind="inflight"``: ``{"probes": <the artifact dict, e.g. {"hs_cache": {...}}>,
    "hook_dir": <str, optional>, "layer_to_heads": <dict, optional>}``.
  * ``source_kind="from_disk"``: ``{"run_id": <str>, "hook_dir": <str>,
    "layer_to_heads": <dict, optional>, "run_ids": <list[str], optional -- two-pass analyzers>}``.

PROCESS-VS-THREAD: the same core consume loop (``_consume_loop``) runs on either backend --
``use_process=True`` (default, production) spawns a real ``torch.multiprocessing`` child running the
DEFAULT registry-based ``analyze_fn`` (a module-level function, so it pickles by reference cleanly
for the spawn target); ``use_process=False`` (forced whenever a caller injects a custom
``analyze_fn``) runs the IDENTICAL loop on a ``threading.Thread`` so tests stay fast/deterministic and
can inject an arbitrary non-picklable fake. This mirrors ``offload_process.py``'s thread/process
split, except here BOTH backends are built now rather than a deferred hardening step.

NOT WIRED INTO ANY WORKER (deliberate): this is a new, self-contained module only.
``init_server_analyze_process(worker)`` below is the ready lazy-start hook -- mirrors
``writer_process.init_writer_process`` exactly (idempotent, default-OFF here pending
calibration) -- for a future request-start router to call once an ``analyze_where`` exists to
route to. This module does not touch ``PerRequestIndex``, the drain, the QK path,
``get_captured_states``, ``flush_ring*``, ``get_ring_per_request``, or the router.
