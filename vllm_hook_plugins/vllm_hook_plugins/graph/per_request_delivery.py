"""Per-request demux + finish-tracking + assembly for the off-loop delivery pipeline.

Rows arrive step-by-step keyed by (req_id, layer); PerRequestIndex buffers them in append
order, and once a request is marked finished its rows are ready to assemble (torch.cat in
append order) and hand off. FINISH is enqueued after a request's last step (FIFO), so by the
time mark_finished fires all of that request's rows are already present. Pure logic — no
torch ops beyond cat, no GPU, no disk.

QK ASSEMBLY: a single (req, layer) needs TWO independent row streams: q (post-RoPE query, emitted
only on emit_q steps) and k_full (the growing key history, appended every step). Both stage
through the SAME unmodified `note_rows` by using DISTINCT tuple layer keys — `("q", layer)` /
`("k", layer)`. `assemble_qk` reads those two streams off a request's entry and rebuilds `k_all`
via the same growing-prefix pattern `ring_reader.load_multilayer_qk_ring_artifact` uses: `k_full =
torch.cat(k_blocks)`, `k_all = [k_full[:L] for L in prefix_ends]`.

prefix_ends CONTRACT: the caller passes `kmeta={"prefix_ends": [...]}` on the `("k", layer)`
`note_rows` call as the FULL CUMULATIVE list-so-far, not a per-step delta (step 1 passes `[3]`,
step 2 `[3, 4]`, step 3 `[3, 4, 5]`); `kmeta=None` on a step with no new prefix boundary. This
rides `note_rows`'s existing LAST-WRITE-WINS kmeta store as-is — the final call's list is the one
that survives at finish time, so no accumulation logic is needed in this module."""

    `PerRequestIndex._entry` builds / stores in `_entries[req_id]`: `{"layers", "finished", "kmeta"}`).

    Reads the `("q", layer)` / `("k", layer)` staged streams (see the module docstring for the
    staging + prefix_ends contracts) and returns
    `{layer: {"q": <cat q rows>, "k_all": [k_full[:L] for L in prefix_ends]}}` for every layer that
    has a `("k", layer)` stream. `k_full` and `q` are each `torch.cat` of their blocks in append
    (step) order — the same order `note_rows` recorded them, matching `pop_deliverable`'s plain-cat
    convention. A captured layer always emits at least one q row (all_tokens: every step; last_token:
    the final prefill chunk + every decode step), so a layer with k rows but zero q rows is a genuine
    anomaly, not a normal empty case: this raises `ValueError` rather than fabricating an empty-q
    tensor (unlike `ring_reader`, which reads a dedicated `q_row_shape` from its sidecar header and can
    legitimately report an empty q).
