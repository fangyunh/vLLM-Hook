"""Multi-layer host drain for the HS capture ring.

Decoder-layer rings share ONE logical cursor (every layer scatters the same tokens each step).
Each pass reads every per-layer ``hs_buf``'s new ``[drain, write)`` segment, appends it to that
layer's raw file, and appends this step's ``LayerEntry`` records to a shared sidecar keyed by
``(req_id, layer)``. SELECTIVE DRAIN (``VLLM_HOOK_DRAIN_SELECTIVE``, default ON) copies only the

the ``hs_buf[s:e].cpu()`` D2H is stream-ordered after the in-graph ``capture_hs`` scatter (same
default stream), so it reads committed rows with no explicit event.

    THE TEST, exact rather than heuristic:

      1. ``len(rec.layers) == len(installed)`` — the fast bail; fewer layers than installed means

    The engine loop, per active step, does an O(1) ``enqueue(entries, start_logical, n_rows, event)``

    step's scatter event, reads each per-layer ``hs_buf``'s ``[start_logical, start_logical+n_rows)``
    region on a DEDICATED COPY STREAM (``record_stream`` guards the source rows), writes per-layer raw
    + sidecar, then ``advance_drain(n_rows)`` — which FREES ring rows and so RELEASES the engine's
    reserve backpressure.

    The consumer reads only COMMITTED ``[drain, write)`` rows (behind the write cursor, disjoint from
    the next step's writes), fenced by the event — never a torn/stale read. The FIFO invariant
    (consumer processes steps in enqueue order, each step's rows begin exactly at the drain cursor)

    ``(layer, row-range)`` tiles some request in that step actually asked for, instead of every
    installed layer's whole step span. See ``build_copy_plans`` for the copy list and the
    degenerate-case contract, and ``_resolve_selective`` for the two consumers that FULL-drain
    regardless (per-request delivery and the synchronous drain).

    TWO consumer modes (``per_request``, default OFF, additive):
      * shared-file (default): appends each layer's drained rows to its raw file + sidecar (above).
      * per-request (``per_request=True``): demuxes each step's drained rows BY req_id into a
        ``PerRequestIndex`` (``_demux_into_index``) and consumes ``_Finish`` items
        (``enqueue_finish`` -> ``_handle_finish`` -> ``mark_finished``) to drive per-request
        assembly, writing NO shared file. The same FIFO queue carries both ``_DrainItem`` and
        ``_Finish``, so a request's finish is processed only after all its rows are noted.

    DISK SUB-ROUTE (within per-request mode; INACTIVE unless ``route_to_disk`` is called): a request
    the router marks via ``route_to_disk(req_id, dest)`` at request-start streams its demuxed rows to
    its OWN per-request run_dir (``_PerRequestDiskStaging``) instead of the host-buffer index, and on
    ``_Finish`` the file is msync'd and handed to an ``OffloadProcess`` for transfer to ``dest`` —
    then its staging state is freed (``disk_residency`` -> 0). A per-request run with no disk routes
    is byte-identical to the host-buffer path above.

        deliverable via ``pop_deliverable``.

        Closes the last-step straggler gap: a request that finishes on the FINAL executed step
        never gets its ``_Finish`` enqueued (``finished_req_ids`` is reported the step AFTER a
        request's last rows — a step vLLM may never run when the last request, or a whole batch,
        finishes on the same step), so the streaming path would silently drop it even though all of
        its rows are already drained/noted in the index.

        MUST run only at genuine end-of-run, NEVER mid-serving: an in-flight request is legitimately
        live and marking it finished early would deliver PARTIAL rows. The sole caller is ``stop()``
        (reached only via the worker's ``flush_ring`` — the once-after-all-requests-finish
        durable-flush RPC; ring-path serve retrieval reads durable files and never touches the
        drain), so this can never fire while a request is still generating.

        Marking all live requests finished also delivers any request ABORTED mid-capture (its
        partial rows) — a conscious choice, acceptable at genuine shutdown. STRICT NO-OP when
        per_request is off (index is None) → the shared-file default path is byte-identical.

        DISK-route stragglers: a disk-routed request that finished on the final step likewise never
        gets its ``_Finish``, so it is still holding open per-request staging. Finalize
        each (close + offload + free) via the SAME ``_handle_finish`` path — so its file is delivered,
        not orphaned. Runs first, before the host-index sweep. An ABORTED disk request still staged at
        shutdown (its ``_Finish`` never arrived) is reclaimed the same way: ``_handle_finish`` takes
        the single-owner discard branch on the ``_disk_aborted`` mark. A routed-but-un-staged aborted
