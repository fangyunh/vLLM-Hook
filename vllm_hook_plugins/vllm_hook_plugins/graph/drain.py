"""Worker-flush barrier for CUDA-graph capture.

The pre-ring off-loop drain subsystem this once served has been removed in favor of the
off-loop ``GpuCaptureRing`` + ``ring_drain_hs``/``ring_drain_qk`` mechanism. Only the
flush-time barrier survives here — it waits on whatever side-stream state a worker actually
holds (read via ``getattr`` so it is a no-op when the attribute is unset, which is the case
on every live path today).
