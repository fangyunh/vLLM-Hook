"""Custom ops for CUDA-graph QK/HS capture and steering (buffer mode).

Three static-buffer ops, all absorbed into the decode cudagraph (NOT splitting ops) so they
replay every step with no Python on the replay path:

  * ``capture_qk`` / ``capture_hs`` — scatter this step's routed q/k / residual rows into a
    static per-layer buffer, in place.
  * ``steer_buffer`` — masked in-place ``residual += coeff * vec`` (unifies add_vector + adjust_rs).

Each mutates its output buffer under a ``mutates_args`` contract so the piecewise/full compiler
threads the write into the downstream graph.
