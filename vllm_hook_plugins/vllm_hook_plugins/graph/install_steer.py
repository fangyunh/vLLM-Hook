"""CUDA-graph activation-steering install (buffer mode).

Steering is the MUTATING counterpart of the read-only QK/HS capture paths: it
adds a direction to the residual stream at one decoder layer so the change
propagates through every downstream layer and shifts the model's output. It is
expressed as the ``vllm_hook::steer_buffer`` op — a masked, in-place
``residual += coeff * vec`` that is NOT a splitting op, so it is absorbed into the
decode cudagraph and replays every step (no Python on replay). The in-place
mutation under the ``mutates_args=["residual"]`` contract threads the steered
residual into the next graph segment. Works across decode under FULL cudagraph.

        forward, and a request lists each target layer once), interned to a stable id; a
        cell needs a rewrite iff that id changed vs the ``_col_state`` shadow.

        The shadow is 2-D ``(num_layers, cap)`` — one interned id per (layer, column). A 1-D
        per-column shadow collapsed the N same-column assignments onto one cell, keeping only

    """W1 idle-skip key for buffer-mode steering (mirrors ``_capture_idle_key``).

    Returns ``_IDLE_ROUTE_KEY`` only when NO request in the batch would steer — a
    constant across consecutive idle steps, so the routing wrapper skips
    reset/build/upload even under churn (where ``req_ids`` / ``qsl`` change every
    step and the default ``registry.routing_key`` would rebuild every step because
    its signature moves with the batch). Returns the *real* ``registry.routing_key``
    signature the moment any request MIGHT steer (or when env-configured steering is
    active, which targets EVERY request) — so active steps keep today's whole-step
    skip/rebuild behaviour byte-identical, and the idle key never leaks into an
    active step.

    Cheap scalar gate only (no tensor writes, no f-strings), early-exits on the first
    steering request. A request with a falsy ``extra_args["steer"]`` cannot steer
    (matches ``_resolve_steer_config``'s ``if not steer_arg: return None``); a truthy
    one is treated conservatively as steering — a false positive (it resolves to a
    no-op via a bad layer/vector) only costs a missed skip, never wrong data.

    Correctness of the active↔idle boundary: the last active step stored a real
    ``routing_key`` as ``_last_route_key``; the first fully-idle step returns
    ``_IDLE_ROUTE_KEY`` which DIFFERS, so the wrapper does NOT skip → the incremental
    router rebuilds with 0 assignments → ``apply_incremental_routing`` zeroes the
    vacated steer columns exactly once. Only *subsequent* all-idle steps skip
    (replaying the now-zeroed slabs = a genuine no-op steer). Symmetric on
    idle→active: prior ``_last_route_key`` is ``_IDLE_ROUTE_KEY``, the new real key
    differs → rebuild writes the new steer columns. No stale steer column can leak.
