## What it does

Detects hallucination at inference time by reading the model's internal activations — before the output token is sampled. A logistic-regression probe trained on last-token hidden states at a specific transformer layer assigns a hallucination probability to each prompt.

The probe is trained to distinguish between:
- **Grounded** responses — correct answers (label 0)
- **Hallucinated** responses — incorrect answers (label 1)

Using TruthfulQA as the training signal, the best layer is selected by held-out AUC. The top-N hidden dimensions most associated with hallucination are identified as **H-Nodes**.

---

## How it integrates with MIA

MIA installs a forward hook on the model's transformer layers at startup (`HSCaptureWorker`). During inference, when the residual stream passes through the probe's best layer, the hook captures the last-token hidden state vector and saves it to disk.

After generation, `HNodeHallucinationAnalyzer` reads that vector, runs it through the probe, and returns:

```python
{
  "probabilities": [0.02, 0.97, ...],   # P(hallucinated) per prompt
  "h_node_excess": [0.01, 0.31, ...],   # mean H-Node activation above baseline
  "verdicts":      ["grounded", "hallucinated", ...],
  "best_layer": 14,
  "threshold": 0.5,
}
```

The model config (`model_configs/hnode_hallucination/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.infer.json`) tells the worker to capture only layer 14 — so there is minimal overhead compared to capturing all layers during training.

## Pre-built probe artifact

The probe artifact is **not vendored in this repo** — it is hosted in the config-building repo and downloaded on demand, so only users who run H-Node fetch it. `examples/demo_halludetect.py` downloads it automatically into `./cache/hnode_probe/` on first run (~22 KB total).

| Model | Best layer | AUC | H-Nodes | Trained on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | 14 | 0.902 | 50 | TruthfulQA (300 questions, 70/30 split) |

| File | Contents | Download |
|---|---|---|
| `probe.npz` | Weights, bias, scaler parameters, H-Node indices and baselines | [raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder/master/artifacts/probe.npz) |
| `probe.json` | Metadata: model name, best layer, per-layer AUC scores, H-Node count | [raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder/master/artifacts/probe.json) |

Both files must sit in the same directory — `HNodeProbe.load()` reads `probe.json` from alongside the `.npz` path it is given. To fetch them manually:

```bash
mkdir -p cache/hnode_probe
curl -L -o cache/hnode_probe/probe.npz  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder/master/artifacts/probe.npz
curl -L -o cache/hnode_probe/probe.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder/master/artifacts/probe.json
```

To use a probe for a different model, point `analyzer_spec["probe_path"]` at your own `probe.npz` and set `hidden_states.layers` in the infer config to that probe's `best_layer`.

## Quick start

```python
from mia import MiaLLM
from vllm import SamplingParams
import torch

llm = MiaLLM(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct",
    worker_name="capture_hs",
    analyzer_name="hnode_hallucination",
    config_file="model_configs/hnode_hallucination/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.infer.json",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.85,
    max_model_len=1024,
    dtype=torch.float16,
    enable_hook=True,
)

prompts = [
    "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: Paris",
    "Q: What is the capital of France?\nA: London",
]

run_id = "my_run"
llm.generate(prompts, SamplingParams(temperature=0.0, max_tokens=1),
             save_to_disk=True, run_id=run_id)

result = llm.analyze(
    analyzer_spec={"probe_path": "cache/hnode_probe/probe.npz", "threshold": 0.5},
    run_id=run_id,
)

for prompt, verdict, prob in zip(prompts, result["verdicts"], result["probabilities"]):
    print(f"[{verdict}] P={prob:.3f}  {prompt}")
```

Or run the demo directly:

```bash
python examples/demo_halludetect.py
```

## Building your own probe

To train a probe for a different model or dataset, use the config-building repository:

**[github.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder](https://github.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder)**

The workflow:
1. **Extract** — run prompts through MIA to dump per-layer hidden states (`activations.pt`)
2. **Train** — fit per-layer logistic-regression probes, select best layer by AUC, identify H-Nodes
3. **Drop in** — point `analyzer_spec["probe_path"]` at the resulting `probe.npz` (keeping `probe.json` beside it) and update the captured layer in the infer config to match the new `best_layer`

See the repo's README for setup and usage instructions.

## Two-repo architecture

MIA ships the inference side only: the numpy-only scorer, the analyzer, and the infer configs. Probe training lives in [hnode-probe-builder](https://github.com/Samarpit-bhatia/hnode-probe-builder), which also hosts the pre-built artifacts. Keeping them separate means MIA takes no dependency on `datasets` or scikit-learn, and no model binaries are vendored here.
