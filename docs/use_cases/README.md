# Use Cases

Each row maps a use case to its paper, its demo under `examples/`, the plugin names it uses and the corresponding contributor. What each analyzer takes and returns: [`docs/configs.md`](../configs.md#use-cases).

**Note for contributors:** When opening a PR that adds a new use case, append a row here. If your use case ships with a writeup, place it alongside this file as `<use_case>.md` and link it from the first column.
